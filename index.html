    <section id="details">
        <h1>Aluminum </h1>
        <p>    Aluminum (Al) is a lightweight, silvery-white metal known for its remarkable combination of strength, durability, and corrosion resistance. With excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, non-magnetic properties, and high recyclability, aluminum has become an essential material across multiple industries. It is widely used in transportation for aircraft, automobiles, and trains due to its ability to reduce weight without compromising strength, in construction for windows, doors, roofing, and siding, and in packaging for cans, foils, and containers. Aluminum scrap, which includes extrusions, sheets, wires, and mixed alloys, is highly valued for recycling, as it saves up to 95% of the energy required to produce new aluminum from bauxite ore. Common alloys like 6061 and 6063 are particularly favored for their versatility and quality. In the scrap metal industry, clean, sorted aluminum remains a top commodity, supporting sustainable practices while providing a high-value resource for manufacturing and industrial applications. </p>
        <h1>Copper </h1>
        <p>   Copper (Cu): Copper is a reddish-brown, highly conductive metal that plays a crucial role in electrical and thermal applications. Its excellent conductivity, malleability, and corrosion resistance make it indispensable for electrical wiring, motors, transformers, and industrial machinery. Copper scrap, including bare wires, cables, and mixed alloys, is highly sought after in the recycling industry due to its ability to be reused repeatedly without losing quality. Copper also finds applications in plumbing, roofing, and electronics, making it a versatile and valuable material worldwide. Recycling copper not only conserves natural resources but also significantly reduces energy consumption compared to producing copper from ore, making it both economically and environmentally advantageous. </p>
        <h1>Stainless Steel</h1>
        <p>    Stainless Steel (304/316): Stainless steel, particularly grades 304 and 316, is an alloy known for its strength, durability, and outstanding resistance to corrosion and oxidation. Its sleek, silver appearance and hygienic properties make it ideal for kitchen equipment, medical instruments, construction, and industrial machinery. Grade 316 stainless steel, enriched with molybdenum, offers superior resistance to saltwater corrosion, making it perfect for marine applications. Stainless steel scrap, including sheets, pipes, and machinery components, is highly valued for recycling, as it can be melted down and reused without degradation. This metal combines sustainability, aesthetic appeal, and longevity, ensuring it remains a cornerstone in manufacturing and industrial applications. </p>
        <h1>HMS</h1>
        <p>    HMS Scrap (Heavy Melting Steel): HMS scrap refers to heavy melting steel, typically sourced from used machinery, structural steel, ship parts, and industrial components. It is a key raw material for steel production, providing a sustainable and cost-effective source of metal for steel mills. HMS scrap comes in various grades and thicknesses, often classified as HMS 1 or HMS 2, depending on its size and quality. Its high iron content and consistent composition make it ideal for melting in electric arc furnaces to produce new steel products. By recycling HMS scrap, manufacturers reduce the need for raw iron ore, lower energy consumption, and minimize environmental impact while maintaining high-quality steel output. </p>
